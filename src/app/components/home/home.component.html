    <h2>History:</h2>
    <div class="homebody">
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of
        superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic
        books
        published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and
        literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by
        crossing
        over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

        The first MCU film is Iron Man (2008), which began the films of Phase One culminating in the crossover film The
        Avengers (2012). Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began
        with
        Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). The first three phases in
        the
        franchise are collectively known as "The Infinity Saga". The films of Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021).

        Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, before
        further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu, and cable television on Freeform. They also
        produced
        the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own television series
        for
        streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. The MCU also includes
        tie-in
        comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral
        marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront and TheDailyBugle.net.

        The franchise has been commercially successful and has generally received positive reviews. It has inspired
        other
        film and television studios to attempt to create similar shared universes with comic book character adaptations.
        The
        MCU has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each
        film,
        multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.
